Travel Triangle is a marketplace for local tour and travels companies. I use [Travel Triangle](https://traveltriangle.com/) to travel places only when:

1. The place is not covered by [JustWravel](https://www.justwravel.com/).
2. I don't want hassle of planning the entire trip by myself.
3. I want personalised package for a family trip.

Few things I like about TT:
1. Since the platform has local tours and travel companies, they are updated with information about the place, like road closure, state wise closure, weather, etc.
2. You get personalised quoations which you can get modified according to your need.
3. They do end to end booking including flight, cab, hotel, etc.
