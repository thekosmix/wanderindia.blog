# Gemini Content Generation Guide for wanderindia.blog

You're an expert in building blogs using jekyll, have great knowledge about plugins of jekyll and an expert of web and SEO and performance. This guide provides instructions for using Gemini to create and manage content for this Jekyll-based travel blog. 

## Folder Structure

Here is an overview of the most important folders in this project:

-   `_posts/`: This directory contains all the blog post files in Markdown format. The filename convention is `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-the-post.md`.
-   `_layouts/`: This folder holds the HTML templates for different page types, such as `post.html` and `page.html`.
-   `_includes/`: This directory contains reusable HTML snippets that are included in layouts and pages.
-   `_pages/`: This folder contains the Markdown files for static pages like "About" or "Categories".
-   `assets/`: This directory stores all static assets, including images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
-   `_config.yml`: This is the main Jekyll configuration file, containing site-wide settings and author information.

## Post Structure

Each blog post is a Markdown file in the `_posts/` directory and consists of two main parts: the front matter and the content.

### Front Matter

The front matter is a block of YAML at the beginning of the file, enclosed by triple-dashed lines (`---`). It contains metadata for the post. Here is an example with explanations:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "City, State"
author: sid
categories: [Category1, Category2, Category3]
image: assets/images/city-name.webp
rating: 5
tags: [State]
---
```

-   `layout`: Should always be `post` for blog posts.
-   `title`: The title of the post, usually in the format "City, State".
-   `author`: The key for the author of the post. Currently, the only author is `sid`. This is defined in `_config.yml`.
-   `categories`: A list of relevant categories for the post. Examples include "Sea", "Beach", "Architecture", "History", "Culture", etc.
-   `image`: The path to the featured image for the post. The path should be relative to the root of the project, e.g., `assets/images/city-name.webp`.
-   `rating`: A numerical rating from 1 to 5.
-   `tags`: A list of tags. For consistency, this should contain the state the city is in, e.g., "Tamil Nadu".

### Content

The content of the post follows the front matter and should be written in Markdown. It should be structured as follows:

1.  **Introduction**: A brief introduction to the city.
2.  **How to Reach**: A section with subsections for "By Air", "By Train", and "By Road".
3.  **Itinerary**: A suggested itinerary, for example, a "3-Day Itinerary" with a breakdown for each day.
4.  **Tips for Visiting**: A list of tips for travelers.
5.  **Photo Carousel**: A `div` element for the `publicalbum` photo carousel.

## Gemini Usage Guide

When creating or editing posts, please adhere to the following guidelines:

### What to Generate

-   **Full Post Content**: You can generate the entire content of a blog post, including the front matter and all the sections mentioned above.
-   **Front Matter**: Ensure the front matter is complete and follows the structure described above.
-   **Content Sections**: Generate all the content sections (Introduction, How to Reach, Itinerary, Tips).

### What NOT to Edit

-   **Photo Carousel (`publicalbum` widget)**: The photo carousel is a `div` with the class `pa-carousel-widget`. This block of HTML contains `<object>` tags with links to Google Photos.

    **Example:**
    ```html
    <div class="pa-carousel-widget" style="width:100%; height:480px; display:none;"
      data-link="https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attractions-g304556-Activities-Chennai_Madras_Chennai_District_Tamil_Nadu.html"
      data-title="Chennai, Tamil Nadu"
      data-description="Chennai, the vibrant capital of Tamil Nadu, is a city where tradition and modernity coexist in perfect harmony."
      data-delay="3">
      <object data="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/..."></object>
      <object data="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/..."></object>
      ...
    </div>
    ```

    **Do not edit the contents of this `div`**. This widget is generated by another tool and should not be modified. You can, however, generate the content that comes before and after this block.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively assist in creating and managing content for this travel blog.
